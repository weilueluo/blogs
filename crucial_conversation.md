## Why we care

> A discussion between two or more people where (1) stakes are high, (2) opinion vary, (3) emotions run strong.

Consider conversations might have happened in our day-to-day life:

- In the middle of a casual conversation with your spouse, he or she brings up an "ugly incident" took place in yesterday's neighbourhood block party. Apparently not did you only flirt with someone at the party, but according to your spouse, "you were clearly making out". You do not remember flirting, you recall only being polite and friendly. Your spouse walks off in a huff.
- Your spouse has been paying less and less attention to you. You realize he or she has a busy job, but you still would like more time together. You drop a few hints about the issue, but your loved one doesn't handle it well. You decide not to put on added pressure, so you clam up. Of course, since you're not all that happy with the arrangement, your dis pleasure now comes out through an occasional sarcastic remark. "Another late night, huh? Do you really need all of the money in the world?" 
- Your roommate Terry who wears your and your other two roommates' clothes (without asking)-and he's proud of it. In fact, one day while walking out the door, he glibly announced that he was wearing something from each of your closets. You could see Taylor's pants, Scott's shirt, and, yes, even Chris's new matching shoes-and-socks ensemble. What of yours could he possibly be wearing? Eww! Your response, quite naturally, has been to bad-mouth Terry behind his back. That is until one day when he overheard you belittling him to a friend, and you're now so embarrassed that you avoid being around him. Now when you're out of the apartment, he wears your clothes, eats your food, and uses your computer out of spite. 

And many more:

- Asking a friend to repay a loan
- Giving the boss feedback about her behavior
- Approaching a boss who is breaking his own safety or quality policies
- Asking a roommate to move out
- Discussing problems with sexual intimacy 
- Talking to a coworker about a personal hygiene problem

In such conversation, when things are heating up, you can do one of three things:

- Avoid or ignore them, and suffer the consequences.
- Face and handle them poorly.
- Face and handle them well.

Apparently you want to face and handle them well, but more likely to happen is, you don't act rationally at your best intention.

- ***We are not designed well*** Our body diverts blood from brain to muscle around the body to prepare for nonessential tasks such as hitting and running.
- ***We are under pressure*** Stakes are high, we might be multitasking and not well-prepared.
- ***We are stumped*** An important question got thrown out, we are not ready to make a hard stop to think about it, and we make cheap shots without thinking.

It has been observed that results of such heated conversations often fall into three categories:

- Digress into threats and name-calling.
- Revert to silent and silent fuming.
- Speak openly, honestly, and effectively.

Two scholars, Clifford Notarius and Howard Markman, observed couples who engaged in heated discussions, they predicted nearly 90% of the divorces that occurred. Over time, people who found a way to state their opinions about high-stakes, controversial, and emotional issues honestly, respectfully remained together. Those who didn't, split up.

Criminals in prison are not always a career criminal, over half of the people who are convicted crimes are first time offenders who commit crimes against their loved ones and friends. They once had a job, paid their bills and remembering friends' birthday, but unresolved problem builds up and then boiled over into acts of hatred.

Research done by Dr. Janice Kiecolt-Glaser and Dr. Ronald Glaser found those who routinely fails their crucial conversations had far weaker immune systems. When facing life-threatening diseases, studies also showed significantly higher recovering rate for people who have effective communication skills.

I hope the above is enough to convince you handling a crucial conversation. Ironically, the more crucial the conversation, the less likely we are able to handle it well. As we step up to a crucial conversation and handle it well, from our careers, relationships, to personal health, can all be benefited. So what can we do about it?

> Throughout the book, there are many example dialogues, as much as I want to shorten this notes down to the essence, I felt these dialogues are too important to be skipped. So, let's go.

## Start With Heart

### Fill the Share Pool of Meaning

Kevin, his peers, and their boss were deciding on a new location for their offices-would they move across town, across the state, or across the country? The first two execs presented their arguments for their top choices, and as expected, their points were greeted by penetrating questions from the full team. No vague claim went unclarified, no unsupported reasoning unquestioned.

Then Chris, the CEO, pitched his preference-one that was both unpopular and potentially disastrous. However, when peo ple tried to disagree or push back on Chris, he responded poorly. Since he was the big boss, he didn't exactly have to browbeat people to get what he wanted. Instead, he became slightly defensive. First he raised an eyebrow. Then he raised his finger. Finally he raised his voice-just a little. It wasn't long until people stopped questioning him, and Chris's inadequate proposal was quietly accepted.

Well almost. That's when Kevin spoke up. His words were simple enough-something like, "Hey Chris, can I check some thing out with you?" 

The reaction was stunning-everyone in the room stopped breathing. But Kevin ignored the apparent terror of his colleagues and plunged on ahead. In the next few minutes he in essence told the CEO that he appeared to be violating his own decision-making guidelines. He was subtly using his power to move the new offices to his hometown.

Kevin continued to explain what he saw happening, and when he finished the first crucial minutes of this delicate exchange, Chris was quiet for a moment. Then he nodded his head. "You're absolutely right," he finally concluded. "I have been trying to force my opinion on you. Let's back up and try again."

This was a crucial conversation, and Kevin played no games whatsoever. He didn't resort to silence like his colleagues, nor did he try to force his arguments on others. As a result, the team chose a far more reasonable location and Kevin's boss appreciated his candor.

We look at a conversation as a group of sentences, each incrementally adds some meaning to the shared pool, even if it seems controversial. As more accurate information and more ideas are added to the pool, better decision we can make. To do this we need people to speak up, even if the idea is against idea from someone more powerful.

### A Moment of Truth

Greta, the CEO of a mid-sized corporation, is two hours into a rather tense meeting with her top leaders. For the past six months she has been on a personal campaign to reduce costs. Little has been accomplished to date, so Greta calls the meeting. Surely people will tell her why they haven't started cutting costs. After all, she has taken great pains to foster candor. 

Greta has just opened the meeting to questions when a man ager haltingly rises to his feet, fidgets, stares at the floor, and then nervously asks if he can ask a very tough question. The way the fellow emphasizes the word very makes it sound as if he's about to accuse Greta of kidnapping the Lindbergh baby. 

The frightened manager continues. "Greta, you've been at us for six months to find ways to cut costs. I'd be lying if I said that we've given you much more than a lukewarm response. If you don't mind, I'd like to tell you about one thing that's making it tough for us to push for cost cuts." 

"Great. Fire away," Greta says as she smiles in response. "Well, while you've been asking us to use both sides of our paper and forego improvements, you're having a second office built." 

Greta freezes and turns bright red. Everyone looks to see what will happen next. The manager plunges on ahead. "The rumor is that the furniture alone will cost $150,000. Is that right?" 

So there we have it. The conversation has just turned crucial. Someone has just poured a rather ugly tidbit into the pool of meaning. Will Greta continue to encourage honest feedback, or will she shut the fellow down? Let's have a look at four possible responses.

- "Excuse me", she responds, "I don't think that my new office is an appropriate topic for this forum."
- "You're wrong! We're not spending anywhere near a hundred and fifty thousand dollars on the furniture. It's the redesign of the office that's costing so much, not the furniture." 
- "I can't believe that you're accusing me of squandering good money on a perfectly fine office. Now, if nobody else has any intelligent questions, let's move on!"

Bang, Greta is dead, any sentence above cost her buy-in, confirmed all suspicions around honesty.

- Greta did not give in to her raging desire to fight back and defend herself, she took a depth breath, "You know what? We need to talk about this. I'm glad you asked the question. It'll give us a chance to discuss what's really going on.".

    And then Greta went on to explain she felt that an office was necessary but admitted she had no idea what it would cost. So she sent someone to check the numbers. Meanwhile, she explained that that the building was a respond to marketing's advice to boos the company 's image and improve client confidence, it would be primarily a hosting location for marketing. When she saw the figures for new office, she was stunned and admitted she should have checked the costs before signing a work order, then she committed to drawing up a new plan that would cut the cost by half.

At first Greta felt attacked, but she was able keep her composure by asking herself a question --- "What do I *really* want here?", it has a powerful effect and she quickly realize she was here to encourage her managers to embrace to cost-reduction efforts and influence thousands of others to do the same. Therefore, she was able to *refocus her brain* to what she really wants.

### Conclusion

We often shift our focus sub-consciously, from our original goal to strike back or winning an argument. This is because thousands of years of genetic hand-wiring brings our emotion to quick boil, and deeply ingrained with our habit of trying to win. As we grow older we tends to be more fixated, we might starts out with resolving a problem, but as long as someone raise a red flag that challenges your correctness, boom, we change the purpose in a heart beat. We need to take control of our body, start with a question that brings blood back to our brain. Remember, the only one who can control you is yourself.

- "What does my behaviour tell me about what my motives are?" 
- "What do I want for myself? For others? For the relationship?"
- "How would I behave if this were what I really wanted?"

Think about what else you can say, refuse the *Sucker's Choice* where you choose between honest or peace --- there is always a third option, find it! Someone had to speak up, we are so uncomfortable with the immediate conflict that we accept the certainty of bad results to avoid possibility of uncomfortable conversation. We choose peace over conflict, but it is not to our long-term interest. In Greta's case, if nobody raised concern over the new office, Greta would never learned the real issue, and people will continue drag their feet.

## Learn to Look

We should watch the content of the conversation, from a higher perspective, by realizing a conversation turns ugly, you can respond and work our way back to a healthy conversation. You should watch for signals, physical signals like stomach getting tight and eyes get dry; or emotional signals like raising tone of the voice, and speaks faster than they usual do. 

Remember, we need to keep a conversation ***safe***, when a conversation is safe, and people do not act defensively, and you can literally say anything. Do you recall when was the last time you accept a potentially threatening feedback? I guess you must have accepted some of them from your parents or teachers. Why? Because you believe that person had your best interest in mind, they will not say anything unreasonable, they are not your enemy and you feel *safe*. 

On the other hand, if people does not feel safe, even well-intended comments are suspected. You need to ensure people feel safe before putting out your potentially controversial comments. If not, they may start making fun of you so that they feel safer. In this case, you should treat their silence or even attacks as a sign of they are not feeling safe, and respond in kind. This is no easy task and requires conscious training.

### Silence

Silence is an act of withhold information from the pool of meaning, it is almost always a sign of avoiding potential problems, range from playing verbal games to avoiding a person entirely.

- **Masking** Understating or selectively showing our true opinions. Sarcasm, sugarcoating, and couching are some of the more popular forms. 

    - **Say** "I think your idea is, uh, brilliant. Yeah, that's it. I just worry that others won't catch the subtle nuances. Some ideas come before their time, so expect some, uh, minor resistance. "
        **Meaning** Your idea is insane, and people will fight it with their last breath.

    - **Say** "Oh yeah, that'll work like a charm. Offer people a discount, and they'll drive all the way across town just to save six cents on a box of soap. Where do you come up with this stuff?"
        **Meaning** What a dumb idea.

- **Avoiding** Steering completely away from sensitive subjects. We talk, but without addressing the real issues. 

    - **Say** "How does your new suit look? Well, you know that blue's my favourite colour. "
        **Meaning** What happened? Did you buy clothes at the circus?

    - **Say** "Speaking of ideas fo r cost cutting-did you see Friends last night? Joey inherited a bunch of money and was buying stu pid stuff. It was a hoot. "
        **Meaning** Let's not talk about how to cut costs, It always leads to a fight

- **Withdrawing** Pulling out of a conversation altogether. We either exit the conversation or exit the room.

    - **Say** "Excuse me. I've got to take this call. "
        **Meaning** I'd rather gnaw off my own arm than spend one more minute in this useless meeting. 

    - **Say** "Sorry, I'm not going to talk about how to split up the phone bill again. I'm not sure our friendship can stand another bat tle. " (Exits.) 
        **Meaning** We can't talk about even the simplest of topics with out arguing.


### Violence

Violence consists of any verbal strategy that attempts to convince, control, or compel others to your point of view. It violates safety by trying to force meaning into the pool. Methods range from name-calling and monologuing to making threats. The three most common forms are controlling, labeling, and attacking.

- **Controlling** Coercing others to your way of thinking. It's done through either forcing your views on others or domi nating the conversation. Methods include cutting others off, overstating your facts, speaking in absolutes, changing sub jects, or using directive questions to control the conversation.
    - **Say** "There's not a person in the world who hasn't bought one of these things. They're the perfect gift. "
        **Meaning** I can't justify spending our hard-earned savings on this expensive toy, but I really want it.
    - **Say** "We tried their product, but it was an absolute disaster. Every one knows that they can't deliver on time and that they offer the worst customer service on the planet. "
        **Meaning** I'm not certain of the real facts so I'll use hyperbole to get your attention.
- **Labelling** Putting a label on people or ideas so we can dis miss them under a general stereotype or category.
    - **Say** "Your ideas are practically Neanderthal. Any thinking person would follow my plan. "
        **Meaning** I can't argue my case on its merits.
    - **Say** "You're not going to listen to them are you? For crying out loud! First, they're fro m headquarters. Second, they're engineers. Need I say more?"
        **Meaning** If I pretend that all people from headquarters and all engineers are somehow bad and wrong, I won't have to explain anything.
- **Attacking** You've moved from winning the argument to making the person suffer.
    - **Say** "Try that stupid little stunt and see what happens."
        **Meaning** I will get my way on this even if I have to bad-mouth you and threaten some vague punishment.
    - **Say** "Don't listen to a word Jim is saying. I'm sorry Jim, but I'm on to you. You're just trying to make it better for your team while making the rest of us suffer. I've seen you do it before. Yo u're a real jerk, you know that? I'm sorry, but someone has to have the guts to tell it like it is. "
        **Meaning** To get my way I'll say bad things about you and then pretend that I'm the only one with any integrity.

### Style Under Stress

Self monitoring is hard, we speak when we shouldn't and we do things we don't intend to. We often make a judgement without going through in-depth thinking and words split out after a thought flashes.

- "People were always talking about how mean this guy was who lived on our block. But I decided to go see for myself. I went to his door, but he said he wasn't the mean guy, the mean guy lived in that house over there. 'No, you stupid idiot,' I said, 'that's my house. "
- You're talking to your spouse about the fact that he or she left you sitting at the auto repair shop for over an hour. After pointing out that it was a simple misunderstanding, your spouse exclaims: "You don't have to get angry." Then you utter those famous words: "I'm not angry!"
- "What's wrong?", "Nothing's wrong," you whimper. Then you shuffle your feet, stare at the floor, and look wounded.

To break from this insidious cycle, we need to be able to identify ourselves

- Learn to look at content and conditions.
- Look for when things become crucial.
- Learn to watch for safety problems.
- Look to see if others are moving toward silence or violence.
- Look for outbreaks of your Style Under Stress (see below).
